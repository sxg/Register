# Register

This is an [Electron][1] app that performs image registration using [BROCCOLI][2]. This app is compatible with macOS and Linux. Windows support is limited by BROCCOLI but may be available in the future.

Register supports `.mat` and `.h5` files as input and will create an output file named `registeredImages.mat`.

## Installation

To run this app, you'll need Python 3 with these libraries:

- scipy
- numpy
- nibabel
- hdf5storage

Once these are installed, run `pyinstaller register.py` to create the executable Python script. If an error referencing `scipy._lib.messagestream` appears, then add `scipy._lib.messagestream` as a hidden import in `register.spec`, and then run `pyinstaller register.spec`. After this, run `npm install` and `electron .` to run the app.

To create a macOS app, just install [electron-packager][3] and run `electron-packager .`. This will create a new directory containing an executable `Register.app` file. On Linux, install electron-packager and [electron-installer-debian][4] and run `electron-packager .` followed by `electron-installer-debian --src <Path to Register.app> --dest . --arch amd64`. This will create an installable `.deb` file.
